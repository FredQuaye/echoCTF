CVE-2019-14813 is a .forceput exposure from setsystemparams that bypasses -dSAFER in ghostScript 9.x before 9.50. 

Doing a quick google search for that particular CVE, I found a ton of links related to the particular cve but non of them gave a specific exploit.

Doing a new google search but this time added **exploit** to the search query gave me the exploit below

 modify the `id` to any system command you want. 
Now connect to the server using 
```bash
nc 10.0.200.13 12345
```

**NOTE:** (I tried getting a reverse shell but didn't work for me, It might work for you though)

Doing mine manually, I changed the `id` to `ls -la /root/; env; cat /etc/passwd; cat /etc/shadow; cat /root/ETSCTF`

AND GOT ALL FLAGS :)

Happy Hacking
